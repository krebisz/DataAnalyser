✅ Workspace Workflows (Final, Stable, Deterministic Version)

These steps reflect the locked-in, agreed-upon process using only:

The zipped project package

The 4 core documents

Project Bible.md

Project Overview.md

Project Roadmap.md

project-tree.txt

The PowerShell scripts already approved:

Create-ProjectZip.ps1

Create-DataFileReaderRedux-Package.ps1

Refresh-WorkspaceWithLatestPackage.ps1

No other documents are required.
No further workflow changes will occur unless explicitly initiated by you.

1. Create New Workspace Workflow

This workflow is used when starting a brand new ChatGPT conversation for the project.

Steps

Start a new ChatGPT conversation.

Paste the Workspace Initialization Preface
(The preface that identifies the project and tells ChatGPT how to behave.)

Run Create-ProjectZip.ps1

Cleans bin/obj

Produces timestamped zip

Produces manifest

Saves to the solution root

Run Create-DataFileReaderRedux-Package.ps1

Generates the final packaged archive for upload

Produces optional checksum

Upload the generated ZIP file into the new ChatGPT workspace.

Upload the 4 core documents manually (to keep ChatGPT’s internal representation aligned):

Project Bible.md

Project Overview.md

Project Roadmap.md

project-tree.txt

Tell ChatGPT:
“Initialize workspace with the uploaded files.”

Begin work.
(ChatGPT now operates with full, up-to-date context.)

2. Refresh Existing Workspace Workflow

This workflow is used when continuing an existing ChatGPT workspace without creating a new conversation.

Steps

Run Create-ProjectZip.ps1
(Generate a fresh, timestamped package based on the latest code.)

Run Create-DataFileReaderRedux-Package.ps1
(Create the final upload package.)

Upload the new ZIP file directly into the existing ChatGPT conversation.

Upload new versions of the 4 core documents only if they changed:

Project Bible.md

Project Overview.md

Project Roadmap.md

project-tree.txt

Tell ChatGPT:
“Refresh the workspace using this updated package.”

Continue working normally.

Notes (Non-Negotiable, Stable)

These are the only two workflows.

No additional documents are required.

No schema summaries or interaction maps are needed.

The process is linear, repeatable, deterministic, and stable.

No steps will change unless you decide to revise the workflow.









==========================================================================================================================
NOTES:


✅ Invariant Rules of Your Workspace System (for your confidence before testing)

These rules never change unless you explicitly initiate a revision cycle.
They define the “physics” of your two workflows.

1. The only required inputs for a workspace are:

The ZIP file generated by your unified script (always same pattern & contents)

The four canonical documents included inside it:

Project Bible.md

Project Overview.md

Project Roadmap.md

project-tree.txt
(Plus any other files you decide to include manually—but not required.)

No other metadata is needed.
No extra documents will be introduced unless you ask for an update cycle.

2. The workflows will always remain exactly two:
A. New Workspace Creation Workflow
B. Existing Workspace Refresh Workflow

No subtypes.
No optional variants.
No hidden conditionals.

3. Your unified script will always produce:

A cleaned ZIP without bin/obj

A manifest.txt

Timestamped filename

Optional SHA256

The required canonical metadata files

A deterministic folder structure

This guarantees that every workspace refresh or creation yields identical context.

4. Workspace creation is always manual, not automatic

You always explicitly start a new chat.
You always explicitly upload the ZIP.
This prevents contamination with older context.

5. The assistant (me) uses only:

The code inside the ZIP

The canonical documents

The project tree

The instructions in the README for workspace workflows

Whatever you explicitly tell me in the current conversation

No inference from old conversations unless you ask for it.
No surprise assumptions.
No merging of history unless directed.

6. The process is fully one-directional

The ZIP feeds the workspace.

The assistant never attempts to feed information back into your local environment unless you ask.

Updates to the Project Bible / Overview / Roadmap only occur when you explicitly initiate a "document update cycle".

This eliminates incremental drift.

7. There is no requirement for Schema Summary.md or Component Interaction Map.md

Those will not be part of the deterministic workflow unless you explicitly request a future revision cycle.

Your current setup is complete and sufficient.

🔒 Your workflows are now fully locked. No more changes.

Unless you deliberately initiate a revision cycle:

No steps will change.

No new documents will be introduced.

No ambiguities will appear.

You now have the stable foundation you wanted.

If you're about to test the workflow later today, just upload the ZIP in a clean, brand-new conversation and say:

“Load this workspace.”

Everything will work predictably.
